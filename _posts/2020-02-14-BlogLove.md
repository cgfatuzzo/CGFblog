# gotta throw some love

hello! since it's Saint Valentine, I have decided to create a new post to host links (yes, again links to other sources) to blogs and content I **love**, being AI related or not.

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=TheBatchAnnouncementAugust132019)
 is a very nice AI news blog curated by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
 
[Thoughts from Inside the Box](https://frominsidethebox.com/), 
a collection of reflections and stories from this Google engineer who lives in a parking lot. Yep, not kidding! 
 Rent is the Bay area is insane, so he decided to go rogue. Only in America?
 
 [La Scimmia Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/user/LaScimmiaYoga) super nice youtube channel with yoga instructions for all levels and 
 virtually all purposes (improve posture, flexibility, mood, sleep, etc.). Italian only!
 
 [Life is a Tango](http://lifeisatango.blogspot.com/) a blog on my most loved activity 
 (yes, apologies, that is not sitting in front of a pc looking for bugs ;P )
 
 More to come, stay tuned!
