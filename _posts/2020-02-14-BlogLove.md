# gotta throw some love

hello! since it's Saint Valentine, I have decided to create a new post to host links - yep, yet more links to cool external sources - to blogs and content I **love**, being AI related or not.  

[The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=TheBatchAnnouncementAugust132019)
 is a very nice AI news blog curated by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), with the ambition of 'cutting through the noise' and deliver all and only the most relevant developments in the field.
 
[Thoughts from Inside the Box](https://frominsidethebox.com/), 
a collection of reflections and stories from this Google engineer who lives in a parking lot. Yep, not kidding! 
 Rent is the Bay area is insane, so he decided to go rogue. Only in America?
 
 [La Scimmia Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/user/LaScimmiaYoga) super nice youtube channel with yoga instructions for all levels and 
 virtually all purposes (improve posture, flexibility, mood, sleep, etc.). Italian only!
 
 [VeroTango](https://verotango.com/) a blog on Argentine tango curated by a professional Russian dancer living in Paris, written in English. Confused yet? Go visit the blog, Veronica Toumanova's writing will make everything clear. My favourite essay of hers (so far): [Why we suffer when learning tango and how that is a good thing](https://www.facebook.com/notes/veronica-toumanova/why-we-suffer-when-learning-tango-and-how-is-that-a-good-thing/10151749288697499). Enjoy!

 More to come, stay tuned!
