# Deep learning to fight drug-resistant bacteria

Machine learning has been successfully applied to physics problem since a few years already, 
so much that [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) has already published a 
[review on the topic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-019-0221-0)! 
I am not aware of what exactly is the status in medecine<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> but I have heard all my friends/relatives 
who are ***real doctors*** worringly discuss the growing issue of drug-resistant infections, so here is a shout-out to them all: AI came in our rescue!

Following a process that reminded me of 
[this](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334209824_Unsupervised_word_embeddings_capture_latent_knowledge_from_materials_science_literature) 
work<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>, researches in MIT have used a deep neural network model to identify new antibiotics.
They investigated a library of 6,111 molecules, computing prediction scores for each compound so that molecules could be ranked according 
to their probability of inhibiting *E. coli* growth.
