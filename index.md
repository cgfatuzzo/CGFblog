Hello to you all, and welcome to this collection of resources. As my first attempt at blogging, I'll keep my fingers crossed and start by thanking [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) for creating [this made-ready template](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template), and [Andrea La Rosa](https://twitter.com/larosaandrea) for bringing it to my attention.
